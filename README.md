# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

1. se_project_express
2. This project was made to make a server that works with the what to wear front-end project that we made back in sprint 11. The server that were buidling is used to return items and users and likes depending on what the user does on the webpage.
3. Technologies used:
   ° MongoDB to help build the database for the project,
   ° VScode,
   ° Postman to test the return of information on the server,
   ° Node.js for the modules regarding the project
   ° Express.js to help build the framework
